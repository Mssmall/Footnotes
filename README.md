FOOTNOTES

Footnotes is a social media platform for English Premier League football fans. As a hardcore Chelsea FC fan myself, I found that there are not many places online where you can chat about football. There are Facebook groups online, but they are often for supporters of a particular club in a certain area. Footnotes has been designed to appeal to fans from around the world, who support a club from, or are interested in, the English Premier League.

Users must create an account first, before they can pick a team and start chatting. Once you pick a team you can write your own posts in the individual club channels. These will also be displayed on your profile wall. You can also comment on other users' posts. The club channel displays all user posts and comments associated with that particular club. It also contains basic information about the club and a list of the users belonging to that club.
